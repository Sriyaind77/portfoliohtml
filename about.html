  <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>
    â€¢	I have a solid foundation in both the front-end and back-end of software development as a Computer Science graduate with a background in web development and current practical experience with machine learning and Python projects. </br>
  I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt to and work with various frameworks or tools as needed, and my recent web development education has given me the fundamental abilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.
